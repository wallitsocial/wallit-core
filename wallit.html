    <strong>What is wallit?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Traditional social networks today are not geared towards the needs of people who
    want to create content around their digital creations (or assets). The need of
    the hour is community and purpose driven social networks where people can
    connect on things they are passionate about. wallit provides such a platform
    for NFT creators and collectors - the purpose of wallit is to provide
    creators and collectors a space where they can promote their digital assets and
    gain traction. wallit would allow users to create and promote posts about
    their listed NFTs within the platform; the users will use the platform's native
    currency Nifty to promote the posts that they create. The users will be able
    to post from wallit to other social media, by doing so they will gain nifties
    with each post they make. Based on the likes and impressions on the users'
    posts, the leaderboards will determine the trending NFTs / creators / collectors
    - leaderboard rankings will determine nifty winners on a regular basis.

    The long-term viability of NFTs requires attracting mainstream users who are not
    deeply versed in cryptocurrencies or NFTs. We envision wallit as an web
    platform for an audience who are not necessarily blockchain or crypto savvy.
    wallit will be a social network with some blockchain aspects embedded into it
    and not the other way round. That's why wallit must have -

    <strong>Nifty Wall</strong>
    </p>

    a place where collectors, artists and marketplaces can show off their most
    prized digital collectibles. wallit will actively post sponsored as well as
    trending and deemed relevant NFTs from marketplaces on users' walls. Metaverse
    Gamers will be able to link their Metaverse username and will be able to show
    off their NFTs and ranks. The entire wall or individual posts can be made
    private or public. There will also be a section for liked NFTs on the wall.
    Other users can show their appreciation for others' walls by `liking' and
    leaving comments. There will be a section on the wall with trending NFTs and
    artists where users will see some of the best, most popular content from di
    erent marketplaces. Nifty Timeline a place where posts from other user's appear
    chronologically. Users can choose to follow another nifty user (from the users
    wall) and will see his/her content any time that user shares something new.
    There will also be sponsored posts which are decided by collaborative filtering
    for best offers to audience matching. The timeline will allow users a number of
    ways to show their appreciation for content posted (digital collectibles and
    scenes) by other members such as liking, commenting, sharing and also giving a
    `tip' in Nifty tokens.

    <p>
    <strong>Target Audience</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Collectors</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Collectors are the people who buy / sell / collect NFTs. They are well informed
    about the current trends in technology and at the same time appreciate digital
    art because of its aesthetic and / or monetary value. These people may already
    own some NFTs or could be looking to make their first purchases. They already
    have a crypto wallet and have made (or are about to make) purchases on platforms
    like OpenSea.

    <p>
    Goals
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Digital art collection: This persona could be an avid enthusiast of digital
    art, and maybe already has artists in mind who they want to follow and buy art
    from. The art collection may not be limited to aesthetic art, it could also be
    digital sports collectibles, video game purchase collectibles etc.
    <li>“Flexing" the art they own: This persona wants to show the world (at least
    show their social network) the art pieces they own
    <li>Investment: This persona may only have a monetary motivation behind buying
    NFTs; they want to create (or further fuel) the hype around the art pieces they
    own so that the value of their art increases and eventually they get as high a
    return on the re sale of their art
    <li>Supporting artists: This persona could have a specific motivation towards
    supporting / hyping certain artists (in the future this could give rise to a
    sub-persona of \digital art promoters")
    <li>Knowledge gaining about the \next best art / artist": The collectors could
    also be using the wallit platform to gain knowledge on the latest artists /
    art pieces
    <li>Video game experience / gameplay / aesthetic enhancement or collection:
    There could be a particular type of collector persona which is only interested
    in video game nfts - they could be buying / collecting NFTs for specific games
    (this could lead to a sub-persona for \video game nft collectors")
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Frustrations
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Lack of a social network where they can post and share the digital art work
    they own
    <li>Difficult to find artists whose art they like and want to buy
    <li>Difficult to track latest trending NFTs and artists
    <li>Artists currently are fragmented across different marketplaces, collectors
    find it difficult to track all / any of them in one single place
    <li>Currently it's difficult to find the influencers" in the NFT art scene -
    collectors who are new to the game do not have a place to get more educated
    about which artists / art pieces are trending
    <li>Current NFT marketplaces lack the social aspect of owning / buying any form
    of art
    <li>No dedicated platform to create hype / awareness about arts they own /
    artists they really like
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <strong>Artists</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Artists are people who create digital art. These art forms could be of any form
    - digital portraits, audio art, video game collectibles, sports moments etc.
    They could be using different kinds of digital / physical tools for creating
    these art forms. These artists could have already listed their arts as NFTs on
    different NFT marketplaces or could be looking to post their first art forms on
    the marketplaces (they may or may not have a crypto wallet accordingly).

    <strong>Explorers / Art Lover </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    These are people who are new to the NFT / crypto universe. They are explorers
    who are looking to make their first investments in NFTs. They have limited or no
    knowledge about NFTs or the artists who are creating NFTs or the collectors who
    are purchasing them (and making thousands if not millions out of their
    investments). These people have the potential to become collectors or even
    artists. These people may have artists in their network whose art forms they
    want to support on wallit. These people may have recently opened a crypto
    wallet or may not have one yet.

    intend to list their arts on
    <li>Follow and support artists: They may have artists in their network who have
    joined wallit; this persona may join the platform for the sole purpose of
    supporting these artists. They may also be interested in discovering and
    following artists.
    <li>Investment: This persona may be interested in finding their first
    investments and making monetary gains on this investment
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Frustrations
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Lack of a platform where they can browse and discover content, follow
    trending artists / collectors, and trending NFTs
    <li>Lack of transparency about the available options in terms of marketplaces to
    list their artwork (for new artists)
    <li>Lack of knowledge about latest NFT trends / marketplaces
    <li>Lack of a community that is built around NFTs - they don't know where to
    start
    <li>Lack of ways to support the artists they know - current social media
    platform offer limited traction and are rather ineffective because of the lack
    of proper audience
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Apart from these 3 core personas on the wallit platform, we also imagine
    certain future personas to emerge as the platform grows. Below the profiles and
    short descriptions of their roles on the platform have been described. Since we
    expect their personas to emerge as the platform grows, it is futile at this
    point to go into the exact goals (we expect them to be solely monetary) and
    frustrations.

    <strong>Marketplace executives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    These are executives working at different NFT marketplace companies. They have a
    vested monetary interest in the wallit platform (explained below in their
    role)
    </p>

    Profile
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Age Group: 18+
    <li>Gender: No Bar
    <li>Geography: Can be from anywhere around the world, but we believe initial
    traction will come from North America and Europe
    <li>Occupation: Sales / Business Development / Marketing executives from NFT
    marketplaces like Nifty gateway , OpenSea etc
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Role
    </p>
    <p>
    As part of the business model of wallit, marketplaces will pay wallit for
    each listing that is created on their platform through wallit. wallit will
    also generate buying traffic for marketplaces (affiliate marketing). wallit can
    also be used to create hype around art pieces and artists, and it will benefit
    marketplaces to pay wallit to promote artists and arts. Due to these B2B
    value propositions towards marketplaces, marketplace executives will sign up on
    the wallit platform to stay on top of the latest trending artists and their
    works. They would also want to attract collectors and users into purchasing arts
    from their respective platforms and are expected to promote their marketplaces
    (and arts listed there) through wallit. They are also expected to create
    posts on wallit, use it as a new channel for outreach to their prospects -
    both in terms of buyers and artists.
    </p>

    <strong>Brokers / Promoters / Talent Managers</strong>
    </p>

    <li>Gender: No Bar
    <li>Geography: Can be from anywhere around the world, but we believe initial
    traction will come from North America and Europe
    <li>Occupation: NFT brokers / managers for artists - they could also have a day
    job and maybe doing this on the side
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Role
    </p>
    <p>
    As artists and collectors start using the wallit platform, there will be a
    need for individuals who could broker the arts created by artists / owned by
    collectors. These brokers could be individual art brokers from different artists
    or could be representatives of artists / collectors. Artists / collectors could
    lend their arts to these brokers, brokers could promote these arts through paid
    promotions / organic promotions and make the sale of the arts. The commission
    they earn on the sales of the arts could be established using smart contracts on
    the wallit platform.

    increase their outreach , hence giving them a reason to purchase and spend
    nifties
    <li>Tips  / donations to artists for their work / collection - this will be a
    community of similar interest

    </ul>
    <p>
    How will people get tokens?:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>First 10.000 signups will get 100 nifties each

    <li>Leaderboards will decide which users get nifties every week
    <li>Posting via wallit on other social media platform will result in them
    receiving a small amount of nifties
    <li>When users import their listed NFTs into wallit they get a small amount
    of nifties as a reward

    <strong>Technology Overview</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    wallit will employ blockchain technologies in a number of ways to help bring
    the NFT community together and to fuel the economic activities within the
    platform.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Blockchain</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    We are evaluating two emergent and promising layer-1 protocols as the underlying
    blockchain for wallit. One is Flow and the other is Solana.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Flow</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Flow is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain, designed to
    scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and
    throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment and
    can be coded in Go or JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Solana</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Solana on the other hand is a fast, secure, and censorship resistant blockchain
    and offers blazing speed and low fees while requiring no sharding or layer 2 and
    can be coded in Rust, C, and C++.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Token</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The platform will be powered by Nifty token. There will be a max supply of 10
    Billion Nifty tokens which will be minted gradually following a transparent
    token distribution calendar. Nifty tokens can be purchased through the wallet,
    or on an exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Reward</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Top Artists will be continuously rewarded based on how valuable the community
    perceives their works to be - as measured by upvotes and ranked in leaderboards.
    The reward mechanism is also linked to the reputation on the platform - with
    reputation being measured as users' lifetime earnings minus erosion due to
    downvotes. Users of the platforms will also receive free tokens through various
    incentives e.g. artists and collectors will receive free tokens when they link
    new content to the platform, as a reward for contributing to the platform
    growth<strong>.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Spend</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Artists, collectors and brands will be able to spend Nifty to promote their
    brands or specific NFTs, pages or offers via sponsored posts. One of the major
    hurdles of normalizing cryptocurrency usage is it's volatility, which
    discourages owners to spend them due to their price appreciation possibility.
    Since spending Nifties in our platform might result in higher ROI from resulting
    NFT sales, this will potentially encourage spending instead of just HODLing
    tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Donate</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    All users will be able to send/receive tips/donations in Nifty.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Wallet</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The platform is targeted to the mass market, it is of the utmost importance that
    the onboarding and purchasing of Nifty tokens remains a task that can be easily
    carried out by consumers with zero knowledge or understanding of the blockchain
    and cryptocurrencies. To facilitate this, users will acquire Nifty tokens using
    cards or paypal, or using BTC/ETH/FLOW/Nifty deposits. When the users' spend
    tokens, the app will seamlessly deduct the equivalent amount of Nifty tokens
    from the wallet. Key functions -
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Connect wallet
    <li>Purchase token
    <li>Deposit BTC/ETH/FLOW/Nifty from a public address
    <li>Transfer BTC/ETH/FLOW/Nifty to a public address
    <li>Token conversion
    <li>Pay paid promotions with Nifty
    <li>Receive rewards in Nifty
    <li>Receive donations in Nifty
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Security and privacy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The security implications of user accounts, especially wallet and payment
    details are paramount. The platform's code and INFOSEC process will be formally
    audited by Certik.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Architecture and Technologies</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The system will be mainly developed using open source projects and will undergo
    various changes in order to be able to handle enormous amounts of user generated
    data in real time and at the same time also be secure and responsive to the
    user's needs.
